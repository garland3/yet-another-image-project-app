# Image Deletion Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented improvements to the image deletion functionality to resolve 404 errors when viewing deleted images and improve the overall user experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. User Interface Changes
- **Removed delete button from image gallery**: Delete buttons no longer appear in the gallery grid overlay
- **Added delete button to individual image view**: Delete functionality moved to the `/view/{imageId}` page next to the Download button
- **Removed debug button**: Debug button removed from image controls for cleaner interface

### 2. Deleted Image Display Improvements
- **Gallery placeholders**: Deleted images in the gallery now show a custom "Image Deleted" SVG placeholder instead of trying to load broken thumbnails
- **Individual view placeholders**: When viewing a deleted image, a larger placeholder is shown instead of attempting to load the content
- **Visual indicators**: Added CSS styling to make deleted images visually distinct with dashed borders and reduced opacity

### 3. Backend Integration Fixes
- **404 error handling**: Fixed the issue where viewing deleted images resulted in 404 errors
- **Fallback mechanism**: ImageView now falls back to the project endpoint (`/api/projects/{id}/images?include_deleted=true`) when the direct image endpoint fails
- **Navigation support**: Project image navigation includes deleted images to support proper prev/next functionality

### 4. Code Quality Improvements
- **Comprehensive unit tests**: Added extensive test coverage for all modified components
- **Clean code**: Removed unused delete modal code from ImageGallery component
- **Consistent error handling**: Proper error states and loading indicators

## Files Modified

### Components
- `src/components/ImageGallery.js` - Removed delete button, added deleted image placeholders
- `src/components/ImageDisplay.js` - Added delete button and modal, deleted image display handling
- `src/ImageView.js` - Added fallback logic for deleted images

### Styling
- `src/App.css` - Added CSS classes for deleted image styling

### Tests
- `src/components/__tests__/ImageGallery.test.js` - 18 comprehensive tests
- `src/components/__tests__/ImageDisplay.test.js` - 17 comprehensive tests  
- `src/__tests__/ImageView.test.js` - 15 comprehensive tests
- `src/__tests__/test-runner.js` - Custom verification script

## Key Features

### For Regular Users
1. **Better UX**: Delete functionality is now contextual - only available when viewing individual images
2. **Visual clarity**: Deleted images are clearly marked and don't show broken image states
3. **Navigation**: Can still navigate through deleted images without errors

### For Developers
1. **Regression prevention**: Comprehensive unit tests prevent future regressions
2. **Clean architecture**: Delete functionality properly separated by context
3. **Error resilience**: Robust error handling for deleted image scenarios
